A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.

C.  Write a class for an element doublely-linked list.

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    
(A)recursion is Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java,in which a method 
   calls itself to solve some problem.We can use it when we put the function itself into the function itself.
    termination step is the first step of the loop when the recursion stops.
    Recursion step is the last step of the loop that use the method itself in the loop itself.
    
(B)
Stack is a LIFO (last in first out) data structure. 
Queue is a FIFO (first in first out) data structure.

(C)
public class DLnk{
  
  private Object payload;
  private DLnk next;
  private DLnk prev;
  
   public DLnk(DLnk next, DLnk prev, Object payload){
    this.next = next;
    this.prev=prev;
    this.payload = payload;}
    }
    
(D) Merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels or values 
    (in case of leaves) of its child nodes.
   
    structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree:They allow efficient and secure verification of the contents 
    of large data structures.
    
    Merkle root is the hash of all the hashes of all the transactions in the block.
    
    The function of a certificate in this data structure is way faster than other loops.
